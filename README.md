I'm [Michael Fornaro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-fornaro-5b756179/), a tech enthusiast with a passion for exploring the latest technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. When I'm not busy tinkering with code, you can find me spending time with my family or enjoying the great outdoors.

I'm proud to have been involved in multiple CNCF projects and to have founded Raspbernetes and heavily involved in the kubernetes@home organizations here on Github. These projects are a testament to my commitment to innovation and to creating communities that share in that vision.

Feel free to take a look around and explore my projects. I hope you find them as inspiring and exciting as I do. And if you have any questions or want to connect, don't hesitate to reach out!

Cheers!
